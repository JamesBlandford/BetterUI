# BetterUI :: Gamepad Interface Improvements
Elder Scrolls: Online addon (written in LUA) which improves the gamepad interface on PC and makes drastic changes to the underlying interface.


---

## Modules
* [Enhanced Inventory]
  * Redeveloped Inventory interface which allows for great customizability, and matching of the Keyboard functionality (such as a "Junk" feature)
* [Enhanced Banking]
  * Programmed from the ground-up to match the [Enhanced Inventory] interface style, and is based wholly on my own code - it is future-proof!
* [Enhanced Guild Store]
  * Features to improve the restrictive default Gamepad design including `MasterMerchant` integration, unit prices, and an expanded row view for detailed 
  guild browsing.

You are free to request pulls into this Git repo, and they will pretty much always be accepted (unless it goes against future changes planned). 

I am seriously in need of translators, so if you speak ANY other language (apart from English), please message me and I can integrate the strings!
